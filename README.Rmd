# FOSTER: Forest structure extrapolation with R

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/mqueinnec/foster.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mqueinnec/foster)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of foster is to  streamline the modeling of the relationship between 
satellite imagery time series or any other environmental information, 
such as terrain elevation, with forest structural attributes derived from 
3D point cloud data and their subsequent imputation over the broader landscape.

The package is organized around functions for data preprocessing, stratified 
random sample selection, spectral index calculation, time series summary metrics calculation, k-NN predictive model development and their accuracy assessment,
and finally response variable (i.e. forest attributes) imputation. The following
figure shows a diagram explaining the general processing flow a user might 
encounter when imputing forest attributes from selected predictors that may 
include time series of multispectral satellite images and topographic variables.

## Installation

You can install the development version of foster from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mqueinnec/foster")
```

## Get Started

A vignette is available to give an overview of FOSTER and run through an example of ALS metrics imputation. 

``` r
browseVignettes("foster")
```

Note that if using the development version of FOSTER, the vignette to be build during installation to access it with `browseVignette("foster")`. It will take a few minutes to build the vignette. 

``` r
devtools::install_github("mqueinnec/foster", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
