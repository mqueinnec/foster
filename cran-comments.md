## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed all T and F to TRUE and FALSE 
* Removed unexecutable code in man/trainNN.Rd 
* Unwrapped examples of functions documentation from \dontrun{}.Small toys 
examples were used and are all executable in < 5 sec locally (assessed with
microbenchamrk package)
  
## Test environments
* local Windows 10 x64 (build 17134), R 4.0.2
* Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
