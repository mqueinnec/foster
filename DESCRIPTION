    c(person(given = "Martin",

Description: Set of tools to streamline the modeling of the relationship between 
    satellite imagery time series or any other environmental information, 
    such as terrain elevation, with forest structural attributes derived from 
    3D point cloud data and their subsequent imputation over the broader 
    landscape.
